# # For loop
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

# # loop through lists
# names = ["Albert", "Tom", "Leonardo"]
# for vardas in names:
#     print(f"Greetings, {vardas}")

# # loop through strings
# name = "Code Academy"
# for raidems in name :
#     print(raidems)

# # loop through dictionaries:
# my_dict = {"name": "Albert", "role": "scientist", "surname": "Jonaitis", "sport": "futbolist"}
# for key, value in my_dict.items():
#     print(key, value)

# # loop through sets, tuples:
# it is exactly the same as with the lists

# names = ("Albert", "Tom", "Leonardo")
# for name in names:
#     print(f"Greetings, {name}")
# names = {"Albert", "Tom", "Leonardo"}
# for name in names:
#     print(f"Greetings, {name}")

# #range() function
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

# Syntax
# range(start, stop, step)

# argument	meaning
# start 	Optional. An integer number specifying at which position to start. Default is 0
# stop	    Required. An integer number specifying at which position to stop (not included).
# step	    Optional. An integer number specifying the incrementation. Default is 1

# x = range(3, 6)
# for n in x:
#   print(n)

# for n in range(0, 10, 2):
#   print(n)

# # break
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
# The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 0.

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   if i == 3:
#     break
#   i += 1

# # continue
# With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#   i += 1
#   if i == 3:
#     continue
#   print(i)
